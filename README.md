### Hi, I'm Jonathan Schäfer. 
Currently I'm studying computer science at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. 

I enjoy thinking and reasoning, working and tinkering with my linux machine and writing well styled code.

> I'm fascinated by what is possible to archive in an operating system like linux, and it amazes me
>  in general what we can do with these little silicon machines.

If you want to contact me, either you already know me or you will find a way to reach out to me ;)
